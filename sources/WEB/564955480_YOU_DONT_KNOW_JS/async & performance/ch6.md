# You Don't Know JS: Async & Performance
# Chapter 6: Benchmarking & Tuning

One of the most common areas of curiosity -- and indeed, some developers can get quite obsessed about it -- is in analyzing multiple options for how to write a line or chunk of code, and which one is faster.

We're going to look at some of these issues, but it's important to understand from the outset that this chapter is **not** about the obsession of micro-performance issues, like whether some given browser can run `++a` faster than `a++`. The more important goal of this chapter is to figure out what kinds of JS performance matter and which ones don't.

But even before we get there, we need to explore how to most accurately and reliably test JS performance, because there's tons of misconceptions and myths that have flooded our collective cult knowledge base. We've got to sift through all that junk to find some clarity.
